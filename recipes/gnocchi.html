            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This home-made gnocchi recipe by Gordon Ramsey is so incredibly easy to make with just a few ingredients. It's light and fluffy and best of all, you can tweak the recipe to add any sort of toppings and sauces you want. We've tried this recipe with green and red pesto, smoked salmon, chicken breast, chicken thigh and they've all turned out absoultely delicious. A word of caution though, we do recommend getting yourself a potato ricer to save time and effort otherwise a normal wire mesh strainer will work just fine but can be time consuming. In the orginal recipe, Ramsey includes a sauce that we have chosen to omit; however, you can follow instructions for that <a href="https://www.gordonramsay.com/gr/recipes/home-made-gnocchi/" >here</a>.</p>
                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Two medium/large russet potatoes</li>
                            <li>50g ricotta cheese</li>
                            <li>90g flour</li>
                            <li>1 large beaten egg</li>
                            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                            <li>Grated parmesan cheese, to serve</li>
                            <li>A few sprigs of thyme leaves (optional)</li>
                        </ul>
                            <h3>Steps</h3>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Bake the potatoes in their skins for 1 to 1¼ hours until tender the whole way through. If using an air fryer, adjust time accordingly. Remove the flesh from the skins (ideally while still warm) and mash until smooth (a potato ricer works best here). Mix in the ricotta, a pinch of salt and white pepper and the flour. Make a well in the middle, add the beaten egg and begin to combine the mixture with floured hands. Work in the thyme leaves and continue until a smooth dough has formed. (Be careful not to overwork it or the dough will end up too dense and won’t expand when it goes into the water.)</li>
                                    <li>Cut the dough in half and shape each piece into a long cigar shape about 1.5cm thick. Using the back of a floured table knife, cut each length of dough into 2cm pieces to make ‘pillows’ or individual gnocchi. Gently press each one in the centre using your floured finger. The dent will hold more sauce and allow the gnocchi to take on more flavour.</li>
                                    <li>Bring a large pan of water to the boil. Add the gnocchi, tilting the pan from side to side briefly to stop them sticking together, then simmer for about 1½ to 2 minutes until they start to float. Drain the gnocchi and leave them to steam-dry for 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
                                    <li>Pan fry gnocchi until golden, adding whatever sauce you'd prefer</li>
                                    <li>Serve warm with parmesan. Enjoy!</li>

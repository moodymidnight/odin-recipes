            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>When I think of comfort food, this chicken curry comes to mind. I remember eating this on cold winter days atop of a nice warm bowl of freshly made rice. It's hearty with potatoes and carrots to fill you up, with just enough red curry spice to feel a kick. A citrusy blend of lemongrass and lemon leaves, and our star player, galangal, will fill your home with a wonderful delicious aroma.</p>
